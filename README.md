## 🚀 Project Overview

Verixar is built to create trust in the second-hand market by allowing buyers to:

- Enter an item’s serial number
- Instantly see if it is currently insured
- Get warnings if the item is risky or no longer insured

At the same time, Verixar enables insurance companies to securely sync policy data and gain visibility into how much fraud they are preventing.
